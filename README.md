Engineer driven by optimization — performance, simplicity, and correctness.  
Less code, more impact.

- I enjoy building systems and understanding how databases and operating systems work under the hood.
- Mostly working with **Go**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **C++**.
- No hobbies outside coding — because building software *is* my passion.
